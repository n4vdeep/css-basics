# CSS Basics

## Selectors
3 basic types:
- Element selector; e.g. body
- Class selector, starts with a period; e.g. .gray
- ID selector, starts with # and should be unique; e.g. #second
- "*" universal selector

## Specificity
An Element selector is the lease specific followed by the class selector and then the ID selector being the most specific. 

NB:Inline styles will override all of the above selectors and the style element selector in specificity however.

## !important
!important wil override every other selector regardless of what method it is. Dont use this unless there is a valid reason.
